    Explain what the %s and %d are used for (with regards to printing)?
%s is used with strings and %d is used for decimals

    What advantages do they have for concatenating strings?


    Try this code


    char str[] = "Reflection and contemplation are life skills.";
              char input[100];

              printf("%s\n", str); //What does this do?
//outputs a string on a newline "Reflection and contemplation are life skills."
              printf("%c\n", *str);//What does this do?
//outputs a character on a newline "R"
                scanf("%99s", input);//What does this do?
//makes a string that is 99 characters long, adds spaces if there isnt already enough scharacters
//outputs "Reflection and contemplation are life skills" preluded by a bunch of spaces
